clean code is not going to happen naturally

## Things that are missing in large scale development
* ownership
* context

## Options
* clean your own code
* don't allow not clean code be pushed
* talk about the motivation to clean to code with others developers
* Mentor-ship

## Good contributions
* infra-relevance - the contribution should help several projects
* you ain't gonna need it
* the boy scout rule
* TDD - GU style - outside in TDD
* regression confidence
